This RShiny project presents a simple analysis of the various athletics clubs in Brittany.([link to the app](https://templier-timothee.shinyapps.io/appli_visu/))

Every year, in athletics, the inter-club competition takes place, covering all the disciplines of this sport, such as running, throwing, jumping, walking, etc. The goal is to rank clubs at the national level. For each category, two men and two women participate, and based on their performances, points are awarded to the club. The aim is to accumulate as many points as possible. 
However, clubs do not have the tools to calculate these points, forcing them to refer to tables to determine the points awarded for their performances. We were asked to develop an application capable of performing this calculation and assigning the corresponding points for each event.
